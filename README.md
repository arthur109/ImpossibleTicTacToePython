# ImpossibleTicTacToePython
This is a super commented tic tac toe bot program which is impossible to beat. There is practically a comment for every line of code.
This made in python 3 and will only work correctly with Mac or Linux, because I am using the terminal color codes which dont work with windows, if you have any idea on how to fix this, please tell me.
